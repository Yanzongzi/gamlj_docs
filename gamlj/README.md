## From source

## Linux

If you are working in linux you can download [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/download.html), then download the .jmo from this link [gamlj binaries](https://github.com/mcfanda/binaries/blob/master/gamlj_linux.jmo).


## Others

You will first need to download [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/download.html). 


You can clone this repository and compile the module within R with 

```
library(jmvtools)

jmvtools::install()

```

# Troubleshooting

## While using the module

Please check out the  [troubleshooting page](https://mcfanda.github.io/gamlj_docs/troubles.html). 


## Installing from source

The modules installs dependencies automatically, but in some R installations the process seems to fail when it comes to the dependencies. The solution is to install in the module build folder the required package that fails before installing the module. For example, if "pbkrtest" fails and you cloned the source in YOURCLONEFOLDER folder, run this before installing the module.


# Versions

Please check out the  [release notes](https://mcfanda.github.io/gamlj_docs/release_notes.html). 



```
package<-"pbkrtest"
dirroot<-YOURCLONEFOLDER
instdir<-paste0(dirroot,"/build/R")
install.packages(package,lib = instdir)


```
