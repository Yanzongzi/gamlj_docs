In this example we work out the analysis of a typical subjects by stimuli design using a mixed model (also called hierarchical linear model or multilevel model). We use the GAMLj module in Jamovi. One can follow the example by downloading the file [subjects by stimuli](https://github.com/mcfanda/gamlj_docs/blob/master/data/subjects_by_stimuli.csv) and open it in [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/download.html). Be sure to install GAMLj module from within jamovi library. 

The design and the analyses are inspired by the discussion of  subjects by stimuli analyses reported in [Judd, Westfall, & Kenny, 2012](http://jakewestfall.org/publications/JWK.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2PT2AzWhJhWKIeuzJDD77OKsEi4UHuXfGy8-JppSA_U9wsdlQl7W3OdqY)

# The research design

Imagine an one-way repeated measures design with two conditions. Condition A and condition B. Each participant undergoes both conditions. In each condition, a series of stimuli is presented, and for each stimulus the participant produces a response (the dependent variable). If we only consider repeated measures experimental conditions, there are two variants of this design [Baayen, Davidson, and Bates, 2008](http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~hbaayen/publications/baayenDavidsonBates.pdf), a) one with stimuli crossed with conditions, and b) one with stimuli nested in conditions. We analyze both and we will see that from a model-building point of view, they are equivalent. That is, the way we analyze the two designs is the same.

## Examples of the design variants

### stimuli crossed with conditions

An example of stimuli crossed with conditions can be: A researcher investigates the effect of colors on reading words. A list of words is randomly chosen from the dictionary and it is used as stimuli in the experiment. The experimental factor is color of the word presented to the participant, repeated within participants: each word is presented to the participant once in blu and once in red on the computer screen. Thus, each participant reads the all words twice, once in the blue condition and once in the red condition. This kind of design is often implemented with different orders of presentation of the conditions to counterbalance order effects, making them a split-plot design. We consider this latter variant at the end of this page.

Another example can be an experiment in which the dependent variable is the response times in a task composed by several trials. The task is proposed to the participants in two different conditions. Thus, each participants responds to the same trials twice, once for each condition.

### stimuli nested within conditions

In the nested within condition variant, the stimuli are different across conditions. Consider the previous example regarding words and colors. In this new variant two lists of words are employed: list A is presented in blue fonts and list B is presented in red fonts. The experimental factor is still color of the word presented to the participant. If the lists, for instance,  are made of 15 words each, each participant reads 30 words in total, 15 in the blue condition and 15 in the red condition. Also this kind of design can feature counterbalancing. We consider the conterbalanced variant at the end of this page.

Another example of this type of desing can be a research in which participants are asked to make judgments about African American and White males, with each stimulus person described with a name and photo. In this design, the experimental conditions are the races of the stimulus persons, with the individual stimulus persons nested under condition [Judd, Westfall, & Kenny, 2012](http://jakewestfall.org/publications/JWK.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2PT2AzWhJhWKIeuzJDD77OKsEi4UHuXfGy8-JppSA_U9wsdlQl7W3OdqY). If we have, for instance, 20 photos, 10 with White stimulus persons and 10 with African American stimulus persons, the participant responds to each photo producing 20 measures of the dependent variable.
