# Common 

### Variable names:
`r version("0.9.5")` 

If variables have names not following R standard, some problem may still appear. The new version should be able to deal with non-standard variables names, but not all bugs related to this have been removed.

### Solution:
Use variable names without space, parentheses or brackets, etc. 

`r version(">1.0.0")`
