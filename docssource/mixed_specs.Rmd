# Degrees of freedom

As far as it is possible, inferential tests are based on an automatic selection of the degrees of freedom for the t-tests and the F-tests. 

* For the t-tests the module relies on the Satherwaite approximation of degrees of freedom as it is implemented by the [lmerTest package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lmerTest/index.html). `Lmertest::summary()` produces t-test DF and p-values in the majority of cases. When the model does not converge, or some problems with the model occur, the DF cannot be estimated and thus the p-values are not reported in the  parameter estimates table. A warning note is displayed in those cases. See details in [lmerTest package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lmerTest/index.html).

* For the F-tests of the main model ("Fixed Effects ANOVA"), the module relies again on the Satherwaite approximation of degrees of freedom as it is implemented by the [lmerTest package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lmerTest/index.html). `Lmertest::anova()` has difficulties in calculating F-test DF and p-values when the model does not converge, there are problems with the model random variances, or when numerical independent variables appear in complex interactions. When the `Lmertest::anova()`  does not produce the DF and p-values, the module switches to `car::Anova(..,type=3, test="F")` function of the R [car package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/car/index.html). `car::Anova(..,type=3, test="F")` implements the Kenward-Roger method for degrees of freedom. A warning note is displayed in those cases.

* For F-tests of simple effects the `car::Anova(..,type=3, test="F")` is always used, thus the the Kenward-Roger method for degrees of freedom is employed. This is because the `Lmertest::anova()` requires the factors contrasts to be `contr.sum()`, which does not allow to estimate simple effects. `car::Anova(..,type=3, test="F")` has not such a limitations, so it works fine for the purpose. 

# Post Hocs

Post-hocs tests are performed as implemented in the [emmeans package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emmeans/index.html). In particular, the actual implementation is as follows (for any given model term selected by the user) :

```
      formula <- as.formula(paste('~', term))
      referenceGrid <- emmeans::emmeans(private$.model, formula)
      bonferroni <- summary(pairs(referenceGrid, adjust='bonferroni'))
      holm <- summary(pairs(referenceGrid, adjust='holm'))
```

Other adjustment methods (that are implemented for other GAMLj modules) are not implemented yet because I did not find enough evidence in the literature in their support.
