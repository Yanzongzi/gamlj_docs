# Post Hocs

Post-hocs tests are performed as implemented in the [emmeans package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emmeans/index.html). For all GZLM models estimated with [glm function](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/glm.html) (all but multinomial model) post hoc are implemented as follows (for any given  `model` and `term` selected by the user) :

```
          referenceGrid <- emmeans::emmeans(model, formula)
          none <- summary(pairs(referenceGrid, adjust='none'))
          tukey <- summary(pairs(referenceGrid, adjust='tukey'))
          scheffe <- summary(pairs(referenceGrid, adjust='scheffe'))
          bonferroni <- summary(pairs(referenceGrid, adjust='bonferroni'))
          holm <- summary(pairs(referenceGrid, adjust='holm'))
      
```


For multinomial models, the estimation is slightly different. Following [emmeans package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emmeans/index.html) manual, the comparisons are carried out on the linear predictor recentered so that it averages to zero over the levels of the response variable (similar to sum-to-zero contrasts). Thus each latent variable can be regarded as the log probability at that level minus the average log probability over all levels.

The comparisons are implemented as follows:
```

model<-multinom(dependent ~term*otherterms, data = data, model = TRUE)
lsm = emmeans::emmeans(model, ~ dependent|term, mode = "latent")
cmp = pairs(lsm,  by="dependent",interaction=F) 


```

This implementation is based on [emmeans package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/emmeans/index.html), which explains that because dependent variable categories probabilities sum to 1 (and the latent values sum to 0) over the multivariate-response levels, all sensible results from emmeans must involve that response as one of the factors.
